This is a Algo/script trading for Deribit.

You need an account with deribit, to test out the code I would recommend you make an account on the testnet environment first

- Download / Clone
- create a Virtual environment
- install the websocket dependency in "requirements.txt"
- add creds in client.py - default is the test environment test.deribit
- RUN from main.py
